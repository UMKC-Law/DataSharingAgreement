From time to time upon reasonable notice, or upon a reasonable determination by Covered Entity that Data User has breached this Agreement, Covered Entity may inspect the facilities, systems, books and records of Data User to monitor compliance with this Agreement. The fact that Covered Entity inspects, or fails to inspect, or has the right to inspect, Data User’s facilities, systems and procedures does not relieve Data User of its responsibility to comply with this Agreement, nor does Covered Entity’s (1) failure to detect or (2) detection of, but failure to notify Data User or require Data User’s remediation of, any unsatisfactory practices constitute acceptance of such practice or a waiver of Covered Entity’s enforcement or termination rights under this Agreement. The parties’ respective rights and obligations under this Section 4.b. shall survive termination of the Agreement. 
* 	Termination. Covered Entity may terminate this Agreement:
* o	 immediately if Data User is named as a defendant in a criminal proceeding for a violation of HIPAA or the HIPAA Regulations;
* o	 immediately if a finding or stipulation that Data User has violated any standard or requirement of HIPAA, the HIPAA Regulations, or any other security or privacy laws is made in any administrative or civil proceeding in which Data User has been joined;

* o	 exercise any of its rights of access and inspection under Section 4.b. of this Agreement; 
* o	take any other reasonable steps that Covered Entity, in its sole discretion, shall deem necessary to cure such breach or end such violation; and/or 
* o	terminate this Agreement immediately, in accordance with Section 4.c. 
* 	Knowledge of Non-Compliance. Any non-compliance by Data User with this Agreement or with HIPAA or the HIPAA Regulations automatically will be considered a breach or violation of a material term of this Agreement if Data User knew or reasonably should have known of such noncompliance and failed to immediately take reasonable steps to cure the non-compliance. 
* 	Reporting to United States Department of Health and Human Services. If any breach or violation is not cured, and if termination of this Agreement is not feasible, Covered Entity shall report Data User’s breach or violation to the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and Data User agrees that it shall not have or make any claim(s), whether at law, in equity, or under this Agreement, against Covered Entity with respect to such report(s).

This section shall survive termination of this Agreement.6 
* 	Injunctions. Covered Entity and Data User agree that any violation of the provisions of this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to Covered Entity. Accordingly, in addition to any other remedies available to Covered Entity at law, in equity, or under this Agreement, in the event of any violation by Data User of any of the provisions of this Agreement, or any explicit threat thereof, Covered Entity shall be entitled to an injunction or other decree of specific performance with respect to such violation or explicit threat thereof, without any bond or other security being required and without the necessity of demonstrating actual damages. The parties’ respective rights and obligations under this Section 4.h. shall survive termination of the Agreement.
