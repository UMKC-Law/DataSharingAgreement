This Agreement shall remain in effect for a term of two (2) years subject to the rights and limitations set forth herein and right of cancellation as set forth herein. The Agreement may be extended by the mutual written consent of both parties for an additional two (2) year term. This Agreement shall expire if the service is permanently discontinued. <br> 18.  This Agreement and all amendments thereto shall be governed by the laws of Missouri applicable to agreements made and wholly performed therein. <br> 19.  User and the City shall in no event be deemed to be in a relationship of principal/agent, employer/employee, partners or joint ventures. <br> 20.  Any recourse against User shall extend only to User and not to any of User’s members or managers. <br>  21.  The parties hereby agree that the City is not guaranteeing the continuity of the Service, nor is it warranting the accuracy of the information provided thereby. User shall at all times defend, indemnify and hold harmless the City and its employees from and against any and all claims, actions, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and disbursements arising out of or relating to any breach or alleged breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the User hereunder, including but nor limited to any claims by third parties relating to or arising out of User’s broadcast or dissemination of images or data offered pursuant to this Agreement. This provision shall survive expiration of the termination of this Agreement. <br> 22.  From time to time upon reasonable notice, or upon a reasonable determination by the City that User has breached this Agreement, the City may inspect the facilities, systems, books and records of User to monitor compliance with this Agreement. The fact that the City inspects, or fails to inspect, or has the right to inspect User’s facilties, systems and procedures does not relive User of its responsibility to comply with this Agreement, nor does the City’s (1) failure to detect or (2) detection of, but failure to notify User or require User’s remediation of any unsatisfactory practices constitute acceptance of such practice or a waiver of, any enforcement or termination rights under this Agreement. <br> 23.  This Agreement does not grant any exclusive rights to the User. The City may, in its sole discretion enter into similar agreements with other entities. <br> 24.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and may not be modified except in writing signed by both parties. Any disputes arising from the terms of this Agreement shall be subject to adjudication in Missouri court of competent jurisdiction. Controversies or questions with respect to this Agreement shall be determined in accordance with the law of the Missouri. This Agreement shall be deemed to be made and to be performed wholly in Missouri.<br><br> 27. {Data Supplier} and {User} shall comply with the provisions of FERPA in all respects.

From time to time upon reasonable notice, or upon a reasonable determination by Covered Entity that Data User has breached this Agreement, Covered Entity may inspect the facilities, systems, books and records of Data User to monitor compliance with this Agreement. The fact that Covered Entity inspects, or fails to inspect, or has the right to inspect, Data User’s facilities, systems and procedures does not relieve Data User of its responsibility to comply with this Agreement, nor does Covered Entity’s (1) failure to detect or (2) detection of, but failure to notify Data User or require Data User’s remediation of, any unsatisfactory practices constitute acceptance of such practice or a waiver of Covered Entity’s enforcement or termination rights under this Agreement. The parties’ respective rights and obligations under this Section 4.b. shall survive termination of the Agreement. <br> 30. Any non-compliance by Data User with this Agreement or with HIPAA or the HIPAA Regulations automatically will be considered a breach or violation of a material term of this Agreement if Data User knew or reasonably should have known of such non- compliance and failed to immediately take reasonable steps to cure the non-compliance.

User hereby agrees to furnish and supply at its own cost and expense all necessary equipment to receive and utilize said information whenever required. Any and all expenses relating to access by User shall be borne and maintained by User.

Any notice, request, demand, consent, waiver, or other item required or permitted under this Agreement or applicable law must be in writing, and shall be deemed duly given or made only if personally delivered, sent by messenger, overnight mail or facsimile transmission to the address of the party set forth hereinafter or to such other address as the party shall notify the other in writing from time to time; such notice shall be deemed effective upon receipt. <br> 14.  The User may not assign, transfer, convey, or otherwise dispose of the Agreement or any part thereof without the prior written consent of the City. <br> 15.  No covenant or condition of this Agreement shall be waived except by the prior written consent of the City.

In addition, if the City determines in its sole discretion, that the User has disseminated the information and images accessed by User in a manner contrary with this Agreement, then the City may elect, in its sole discretion, to inform User in writing of such determination. If the City so elects, user shall have thirty (30) days to take corrective action and if no such corrective action is undertaken by User during such thirty (30) day period, then the City shall have the right to immediately terminate this Agreement, by providing User with written notice of its election to so terminate this Agreement. <br> 17.
