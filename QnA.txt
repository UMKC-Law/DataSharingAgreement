								DOC(1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1): WHEREAS, the City has installed sensors and detectors at certain locations, which are connected to the City’s Data Collection Center located at City Hall, allowing this facility to receive all sensor information at any time.

NOW THEREFORE in consideration of the mutual promises contained in the Agreement and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: 
1.  The City represents that it maintains the operating system that allows the User to access specific data sets. <br>
2.  Unless otherwise agreed in a writing executed by authorized representatives of the City and User, as between the City and User, the City shall own all right, title and interest in and to the Intellectual Property Rights in the Sensor Data. <br>

The City specifically reserves the right to make changes in the form and accessibility of said information as it sees fit without advance notice to User; provided that the City will use best efforts to provide User with as much prior notice as is practicable prior to any discontinuation of access to the sensor data. <br>
4.  User hereby agrees to furnish and supply at its own cost and expense all necessary equipment to receive and utilize said information whenever required. Any and all expenses relating to access by User shall be borne and maintained by User. Information and video images gathered by User from its access to the sensors shall be disseminated by User in a timely manner so as to not undermine the public’s confidence in the City’s efforts. <br>
5.  As full consideration for the execution of this Agreement and for the use of the System, the User agrees to identify the Information as being provided by the City. <br>
6.  The City agrees and acknowledges that the information supplied by it to User may be used for various interactive and related news-oriented services for distribution by means of any form of on-line or broadband transmission system (“Permitted Uses”) served by the Internet/digital websites. User may not use the information for any other purpose without the express written approval of the City.<br>
7.  City data shall not be stored by User on portable devices or media unless specifically authorized within this Agreement. If so authorized, the data shall be given the following protections: <br>

   		 (i).  Minimum physical, electronic and managerial safeguards for maintaining the confidentiality of information provided by either party pursuant to this Agreement<br>
9.  City data must be segregated or otherwise distinguishable from non-City data. This is to ensure that when no longer needed by the User, all City data can be identified for return or destruction. It also aids in determining whether City data has or may have been compromised in the event of a security breach. <br>
10.  User acknowledges the personal or confidential nature of the information and agrees that their staff and contractors with access shall comply with all laws, regulations, and policies that apply to protection of the confidentiality of the data. If data provided under this Agreement is to be shared with a subcontractor, the contract with the subcontractor must include all of the data security provisions within this Agreement and within any amendments, attachments, or exhibits within this Agreement. If the Contractor cannot protect the data as articulated within this Agreement, then the Contract with the subcontractor must be submitted to the City Administrator for review and approval. <br>
11.  The sensor information may be accessed via direct links to the City’s web services. Transferring the contents of the City’s web service directories, in whole or in part, to the User’s site is not permitted. Use of the Camera Settings and Status feeds require IP authentication.<br>
12.  The City reserves the right to suspend access to individual sensor feeds without prior notice.
13.  Any notice, request, demand, consent, waiver, or other item required or permitted under this Agreement or applicable law must be in writing, and shall be deemed duly given or made only if personally delivered, sent by messenger, overnight mail or facsimile transmission to the address of the party set forth hereinafter or to such other address as the party shall notify the other in writing from time to time; such notice shall be deemed effective upon receipt. <br>
14.  The User may not assign, transfer, convey, or otherwise dispose of the Agreement or any part thereof without the prior written consent of the City. <br>
15.  No covenant or condition of this Agreement shall be waived except by the prior written consent of the City. Forbearance or indulgence by the City in any regard whatsoever shall not constitute such a waiver. <br>
16.  The City shall have the right to terminate or suspend this Agreement, upon 24 hours written notice, if the City elects, in its discretion, to cease providing access to the sensors. In addition, if the City determines in its sole discretion, that the User has disseminated the information and images accessed by User in a manner contrary with this Agreement, then the City may elect, in its sole discretion, to inform User in writing of such determination. If the City so elects, user shall have thirty (30) days to take corrective action and if no such corrective action is undertaken by User during such thirty (30) day period, then the City shall have the right to immediately terminate this Agreement, by providing User with written notice of its election to so terminate this Agreement. <br>
17.  This Agreement shall remain in effect for a term of two (2) years subject to the rights and limitations set forth herein and right of cancellation as set forth herein. The Agreement may be extended by the mutual written consent of both parties for an additional two (2) year term. This Agreement shall expire if the service is permanently discontinued. <br>
18.  This Agreement and all amendments thereto shall be governed by the laws of Missouri applicable to agreements made and wholly performed therein. <br>
19.  User and the City shall in no event be deemed to be in a relationship of principal/agent, employer/employee, partners or joint ventures. <br>
20.  Any recourse against User shall extend only to User and not to any of User’s members or managers. <br> 
21.  The parties hereby agree that the City is not guaranteeing the continuity of the Service, nor is it warranting the accuracy of the information provided thereby. User shall at all times defend, indemnify and hold harmless the City and its employees from and against any and all claims, actions, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and disbursements arising out of or relating to any breach or alleged breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the User hereunder, including but nor limited to any claims by third parties relating to or arising out of User’s broadcast or dissemination of images or data offered pursuant to this Agreement. This provision shall survive expiration of the termination of this Agreement. <br>
22.  From time to time upon reasonable notice, or upon a reasonable determination by the City that User has breached this Agreement, the City may inspect the facilities, systems, books and records of User to monitor compliance with this Agreement. The fact that the City inspects, or fails to inspect, or has the right to inspect User’s facilties, systems and procedures does not relive User of its responsibility to comply with this Agreement, nor does the City’s (1) failure to detect or (2) detection of, but failure to notify User or require User’s remediation of any unsatisfactory practices constitute acceptance of such practice or a waiver of, any enforcement or termination rights under this Agreement. <br>
23.  This Agreement does not grant any exclusive rights to the User. The City may, in its sole discretion enter into similar agreements with other entities. <br>
24.  User shall not make any references to the City’s information in any advertising or marketing initiative without the express prior written consent of the City. <br>
25.  It is understood that the User may include information in online traffic updates and videos it provides to its broadcast clients provided that such broadcast clients are not charged any additional amount by virtue of the inclusion of the City’s traffic information. <br>
